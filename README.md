## Stack API - Santa AQ

### Game Scoreboard

#### Running the project

To run the project, clone the repo and enter the root folder.
Once inside, exec
    

    npm install && node index.js

#### API Endpoints

Get actual stack localhost:4000/api/stack/
Push new number localhost:4000/api/stack/push/:number
Pop last number localhost:4000/api/stack/pop
Get max number of the stack localhost:4000/api/getmax

---

##### Possible improvements:

- Make api REST and change the endpoints to GET - POST - DELETE (They are all GET at the moment, for testing it directly on the browser)
- Add a validator to check if data is number or not ✅
- Make a frontend to control all app
- Make a swagger to list all API Endpoints
