## Stack API - Santa AQ

##### Possible improvements:

- Make api REST and change the endpoints to GET - POST - DELETE (They are all GET at the moment, for testing it directly on the browser)
- Add a validator to check if data is number or not - Added on last commit ✅
- Make a frontend to control all app
- Make a swagger to list all API Endpoints
- Persist data on a database for subsequent runnings
